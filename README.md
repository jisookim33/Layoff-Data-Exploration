## Business Task
Analyze layoff trends to identify industry and geographic vulnerabilities during economic downturns, and provide insights to guide workforce planning and risk mitigation strategies.

## Why This Task Matters
- The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruption starting in March 2020.
- Many companies had to make tough decisions around staffing.
- Understanding these patterns can help organizations:
  - Prepare better for future crises.
  - Benchmark themselves against competitors.
  - Identify industries or roles most affected and build more resilient HR strategies.

## Data Exploration

### A. Company Size & Layoff
#### 1. I looked at the percentage of layoffs to understand how large the reductions were.
````sql
SELECT MAX(percentage_laid_off),  MIN(percentage_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE  percentage_laid_off IS NOT NULL;
````
#### Answer:

- The percentage ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no layoffs and 1 indicates that the entire company was laid off.

#### 2. Which companies had 1 `percentage_laid_off` which is 100% of the company laid off?
````sql
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE  percentage_laid_off = 1;
````
#### Answer:

- Most of the companies that went out of business during this period were startups.

#### 3. What can we learn about the size of these companies if we order the data by `funds_raised_millions`?
````sql
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE  percentage_laid_off = 1
ORDER BY funds_raised_millions DESC;
````

- BritishVolt was an electric vehicle battery startup and Quibi was a streaming service company. They raised around 2 billion dollars, but they are no longer operating - ouch!

Any correlation between layoff volume and COVID-19 case surges or policy responses?

Company Size & Layoffs:

Were larger companies more likely to lay off employees?
Did startups or smaller firms recover faster?

Diversity Impact (if demographic data is included):

Were certain demographic groups more affected?

Forecasting:

Can you build a model to predict potential layoff risks based on economic indicators?
